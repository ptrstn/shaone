# ShaOne

A very simple implementation of the (broken) SHA-1 Hashing Algorithm in C++.

This repository does not claim to be particularly efficient. It is used for educational purposes only.

Do NOT use this in production as SHA-1 was broken by Google in 2017. See https://shattered.io/ for details.
